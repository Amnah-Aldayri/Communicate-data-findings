# Project 5: Communicate data findings - Flights Dataset
## by: Amnah Aldayri


## Flights Dataset

> Flights Dataset consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. In this project, we are using two datasets for two years 2007 and 2008. The Total number of observations is 14,462,943 with 29 features. Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process, which will utilities in this project.

- Does the number of flights vary each month?
- What is the most commonly used Carrier Company?
- What is the amount of arrival delay?
- Correlation between Month and weather cancelations
- Correlation between DepDelay and ArrDelay
- Correlation between Time (Year , Month) and Delay type (CarrierDelay , WeatherDelay ,NASDelay , SecurityDelay , LateAircraftDelay)


## Summary of Findings

> - From visualization, it is clear that the number of flights during 12 months are very close in 2007 and 2008.

- We can observe that WN is the most commonly used Carrier Company in 2007 and 2008.

- Through visualization, we can see that there are delayed arrivals as well as earlier arrivals and most of them are between -45 to 45 min differ from the scheduled time.

- December (12) is the most month has weather Delay.

- There is a direct relationship between DepDelay and ArrDelay

- LateAircraftDelay is the highest delay type , While the SecurityDelay is the lowest one.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> - WN is the most commonly used Carrier Company in 2007 and 2008.

-  December (12) is the most month has weather Delay.

- LateAircraftDelay is the highest delay type
